# Production Admin Fix - Immediate Solution

Your production site is running an older version of the code, so the API endpoints I created aren't available yet. Here's how to fix the admin login immediately:

## Option 1: Direct Database Fix (Recommended)

1. **Open Replit Database Panel**:
   - In your Replit workspace, click on the "Database" tab/panel
   - This gives you direct access to your production database

2. **Run this SQL command**:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET is_admin = true, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'boulouza.nacer@gmail.com';
```

3. **Verify the fix**:
```sql
SELECT email, first_name, last_name, is_admin 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'boulouza.nacer@gmail.com';
```

## Option 2: Redeploy and Use API Fix

1. **Redeploy your app**: Click the Deploy button again to deploy the latest code with the fix endpoints
2. **Use the fix endpoint**: Visit `https://safe-boutique-boulouzanacer.replit.app/api/auth/fix-admin-production`

## Current Status

✅ **Admin user exists**: boulouza.nacer@gmail.com is in the production database  
✅ **Password works**: 123456 authenticates correctly  
❌ **Admin privileges**: Currently set to `false` instead of `true`  

## After the Fix

Once you run the SQL command above, you'll be able to:
- Login to your production site with: boulouza.nacer@gmail.com / 123456
- Access the full admin panel with all features
- Manage products, orders, customers, and site settings

The admin panel includes:
- Multi-language support (English, French, Arabic)
- Intelligent product search
- Bulk import/export tools
- Order management system
- Customer database
- Site configuration settings

## Test the Fix

After running the SQL:
1. Go to https://safe-boutique-boulouzanacer.replit.app
2. Click login and use: boulouza.nacer@gmail.com / 123456
3. You should now have access to the admin panel
